#+TITLE: sarso

Sarso is not Jira.

Sarso does a local sync of Jira projects to provide better and faster offline
workflows. This includes integration with Org-mode, faster find and create
methods etc. Sarso is not a replacement for the Jira interface but covers what I
need to do on regular basis, faster.
