Sarso is not Jira.

Sarso does a local sync of Jira projects to provide better and faster offline
workflows. This includes integration with Org-mode, faster find and create
methods etc. Sarso is not a replacement for the Jira interface but covers what I
need to do on regular basis, faster.

** Installation
There are two programs here:
+ A CLI executable, =sarso= for syncing issues to an sqlite database.
+ An Emacs package for working with the database.

For syncing you need to setup few environment variables for Jira. Here is a
slice from .envrc file.

: export JIRA_BASE="https://company.atlassian.net"
: export JIRA_USER="username"
: export JIRA_TOKEN="token/pass"

** Usage
There are a few workflows that sarso is supposed to help in:

*** Making new tickets from Emacs
+ ....

*** Showing tickets in Org Agenda
+ ...
