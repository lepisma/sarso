#+TITLE: sarso

Sarso is not Jira.

Sarso does a local sync of Jira projects to provide better and faster offline
working support with Jira. This includes integration with Org-mode, faster find
and create workflows etc. Sarso is not a replacement for the Jira interface but
I realize I don't really use even 10% of that interface so why pay in time for
the full bloat?
