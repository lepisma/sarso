#+TITLE: sarso

Sarso is not Jira.

Sarso does a local sync of Jira projects to provide better and faster offline
workflows. This includes integration with Org-mode, faster find and create
methods etc. Sarso is not a replacement for the Jira interface but covers what I
need to do on regular basis, faster.

** Installation
There are two programs here:
+ A CLI executable, =sarso-sync= for syncing issues to an sqlite database.
+ An Emacs package (WIP) for working with the database.

** Usage
Here is a workflow for v1 which is a little like maildir sync:

+ Run =sarso-sync= and collect tickets from Jira in an sqlite db. For now, it is
  be a full sync and only for a single project.

  #+begin_src shell
  ./sarso-sync --file sarso.sqlite --project MAC
  #+end_src

+ Work with the database in Emacs/Org Mode.

+ Add tickets to-sync in database from within Emacs and run =sarso-sync= again to
  get the tickets up on Jira.
