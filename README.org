#+TITLE: sarso

Sarso is not Jira.

Sarso does a local sync of Jira projects to provide better and faster offline
workflows. This includes integration with Org-mode, faster find and create
methods etc. Sarso is not a replacement for the Jira interface but covers what I
need to do on regular basis, faster.

Here is a workflow for v1 which is a little like maildir sync:

+ Run sarso-sync and collect tickets from JIRA in an sqlite db. For now, it will
  be a full sync and only for a single project.
+ Work with the database in Emacs/Org Mode.
+ Add tickets to-sync in database from within Emacs and run sarso-sync to get
  the tickets up on JIRA.
